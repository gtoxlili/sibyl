# Limitations

At this time Sibyl provides only the most commonly needed means to interface with the Oracle database. Some of the missing features are:
- Array interface for multi-row operations
- User defined data types
- PL/SQL collections and tables
- Objects
- JSON data
- LDAP and proxy authentications
- Global transactions
- High Availability
- Continuous query and publish-subscribe notifications
- Advanced queuing
- Shards
- Direct path load

Some of these features might be added in the upcoming releases if the need arises or if they are explicitly requested. Some, however, will never be implemented. The latter category includes those that are incompatible with nonblocking execution.
